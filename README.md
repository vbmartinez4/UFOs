# UFO Sightings: Webpage Creation & Dynamic Table

# Overview
As we connect data analytics with visualization tools, we were provided a large data file for a collection of UFO sightings across the country, and we were also tasked with creating a visual representation that would assist the end user filter and analyze the data given to them. Utilizing data visualization tools like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, we need to combine these that would allow any user to perform and interact with filters. Essentially, these are all of the foundational tools needed to construct a live and user-friendly site of virtually any webpage.

As our client Dana has this file of data collections of a number of different UFO sightings and elements associated with their sighting, we need to create a site that will allow for easy viewing and react to user input. In turn, this allows for the data to be converted and create a bridge for an interactive connection between users and the data. 

## Results
When we first access the website, our browser takes us straight to viewing the title header and the blurb that provides insight as to what the subject of the website.
